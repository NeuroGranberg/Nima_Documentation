Let's discuss the main challenges:</p> <p>Dependency Management and Version Conflicts: Different tools and libraries may require specific versions of the same dependency, leading to conflicts. For example, CUDA-enabled applications often necessitate particular CUDA versions, which might not be compatible with other tools in the same environment.</p> <p>Environment Configuration and Permissions: Installing software as root can lead to permission issues in the finallized container, especially when switching to a non-root user. This can prevent the non-root user from using, modifying packages in certain directories.</p> <p>Ensuring Reproducibility: Docker builds can produce different results over time if they rely on external resources that change, such as software repositories. This can lead to the dreaded \"it works on my machine\" problem. For now it is ok but perhaps pinning software versions in Dockerfile and <code>requirements.txt</code> file is a good idea to ensure reproducibility. For system packages, use specific versions in the <code>apt-get install</code> command. For Python packages, specify versions in <code>requirements.txt</code>. However, the best practice is to maintain the Dockerfile and perform versioning!</p> <p>Managing Large Images: Including a wide array of tools and libraries, especially those with heavy dependencies like CUDA, can lead to very large Docker images, which are slow to build, push, and pull.</p> <p>Handling Timezone and Locale Settings: Configuring timezones and locales may seem straightforward but can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly, especially in a containerized environment where the host and container settings may differ.</p> <p>Best Practices for Maintenance and Updates: Regularly updating Dockerfile to accommodate new software versions and security patches is a good idea.

This approach requires a deeper understanding of the ZIP file structure and is generally more technical and time-consuming. Below, we outline a method for manually attempting to repair a corrupted ZIP file, which should only be attempted as a last resort.</p> <p>Prerequisites</p> <ul> <li>A hex editor: This is a tool that allows you to view and edit the raw bytes of a file. You'll need this to directly manipulate the ZIP file's binary data.</li> <li>Basic understanding of the ZIP file format: Familiarity with the structure of a ZIP file, including the local file headers, central directory, and end of central directory record, is crucial.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"workspace/fixing_corrupted_archives/#steps-for-manual-repair","title":"Steps for Manual Repair:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Backup the Corrupted ZIP File: Always start by creating a copy of the corrupted ZIP file. This ensures that you have an original version to revert to if the repair process leads to further data loss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identify the Corruption: Open the corrupted ZIP file in a hex editor. You'll need to determine the nature of the corruption. Common issues include missing or corrupted central directory, end of central directory record, or individual file headers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repairing Missing or Corrupted End of Central Directory Record:</p> <ul> <li>If the end of central directory (EOCDR) is missing, you might need to recreate it based on the ZIP file specification. The EOCDR is crucial for the ZIP utility to understand the archive's structure. You can reference a healthy ZIP file's EOCDR as a model.</li> <li>The EOCDR typically ends with the signature <code>50 4B 05 06</code>. If this is missing or located in the wrong place, you can try to manually add or move it to the correct position at the end of the file.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Rebuilding the Central Directory:</p> <ul> <li>If the central directory is damaged but individual file entries are intact, you can attempt to rebuild the central directory. This involves locating each file's local header (starting with the signature <code>50 4B 03 04</code>), documenting their positions, and then manually creating central directory entries for each file.</li> <li>After recreating the central directory, update the EOCDR to reflect the new central directory's location and size.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Correcting Local File Headers: If individual file headers are corrupted, recovery becomes more challenging. You might be able to copy header information from similar files in a healthy ZIP archive or manually edit the headers if you know the correct values for file sizes, compression methods, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Testing the Repaired File: After making the necessary edits, save the changes and attempt to open the ZIP file with a standard utility. If the repair was successful, the utility should be able to list and extract the files. If not, further adjustments may be needed, or the file may be beyond manual repair.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Limitations</p> <p>Manual repair is inherently risky and can lead to irreversible data loss if not done carefully. It's often a trial-and-error process and may not always succeed, especially with severely corrupted files. This method is recommended only for advanced users who have a clear understanding of the ZIP format and are comfortable working with hex editors.</p>"},{"location":"workspace/infrastructure_workflow/","title":"Data Infrastructure and Workflow","text":""},{"location":"workspace/infrastructure_workflow/#infrastructure-components","title":"Infrastructure Components","text":"<ul> <li>Sectra PACS: Stores and manages medical images, receiving data directly from the MRI scanner.</li> <li>NAS \"Quantum\": A storage solution with limited network file sharing and automatic data anonymization.</li> <li>\"Forskningsdator\" or \"Fractal Grande\": The main server for data analysis, connected to the network with necessary data sharing protocols.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"workspace/infrastructure_workflow/#network-access","title":"Network Access","text":"<ul> <li>Tailscale: Ensures secure network access through a mesh network, requiring device registration.</li> <li>SSH Access: Provides secure, remote server access for authorized users.</li> <li>Portainer: Simplifies Docker container management, facilitating secure application deployment.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"workspace/parallelization/","title":"Parallelization","text":"<p>Running scripts in parallel on a Linux command line interface (CLI) enhances the efficiency of processes by utilizing multiple cores or threads of a CPU simultaneously.
